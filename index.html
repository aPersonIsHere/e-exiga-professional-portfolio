        <article>
            I love game making and putting ideas into a computer screen. I enjoy game making so much, that I have used unconventional methods to express myself creatively.
            Many boast of making games in Unity or in C++, but have they tried using Scratch---or even Minecraft Datapacks? It is true that these engines undeniably make
            better games and are professional level for game making, but I like a challenge. I hit many limitations with low-complexity languages, but I use the brain I have 
            to find workarounds, sometimes making things more exciting than originally planned.
            Its exciting to see a project come to life with many of its smaller systems coming down into a great whole. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Meaning that,
            there is always room for improvement with what is not great on its own.

            Currently, I am a student in the UT Austin Bootcamp and learning to program. A game cannot thrive without its own proper site; no project can. It is also important to 
            learn how back-end development works, since online functionality is a part of almost every game today.
