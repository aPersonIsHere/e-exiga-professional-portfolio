            <li>I love game making and putting ideas into a computer screen. I enjoy game making so much, that I have used unconventional methods to express myself creatively.
                Many boast of making games in Unity or in C++, but have they tried using Scratch---or even Minecraft Datapacks? It is true that these engines undeniably make
                better games and are professional level for game making, but I like a challenge. I hit many limitations with low-complexity languages, but I use the brain I have 
                to find workarounds, sometimes making things more exciting than originally planned.
                Its exciting to see a project come to life with many of its smaller systems coming down into a great whole. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Meaning that,
                there is always room for improvement with what is not great on its own.
            </li>
            <li> 
              Currently, I am a student in the UT Austin Bootcamp and learning to program. A game cannot thrive without its own proper site; no project can. It is also important to 
              learn how back-end development works, since online functionality is a part of almost every game today.
            </li>

              I currently reside in TX, USA with no pets.
