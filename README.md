# e-exiga-professional-portfolio
The Git Repository for Emmanuel Exiga's Professional Portfolio.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to challenge my knowledge in HTML and CSS to create a virtual portfolio that employers will look at. It requires the proper usage of semantic elements, reducing the code, and removing repetition. At the moment, the portfolio is nowhere near complete. However, throughout the completion of this course, the portfolio will receive constant updates.
